Description: There are two goals for SwimmeR as presently constructed.  First, it converts swimming times (performances) between the computationally useful 
    format of seconds, reported to the 100ths place (eg 95.37) and the conventional reporting format (1:35.37) used in the swimming community.
    Secondly SwimmeR converts times between the various pool sizes used in competitive swimming, namely 50m length (LCM), 25m length (SCM)
    and 25y length (SCY).
